# Solidity practices

Currently:

-> `PracticumTwo.sol` Practicum with data types & functions.

-> `MyTokenERC20.sol` ERC-20 implementation practice.

-> `TwoTokens.sol` Manually writed ERC-20 implementation of base contract. Created two tokens with different decimals for experiments. Implemented potato-dex with `buy` and `swap` functions of those two tokens. Needs huge work with security.

-> `MyNFTERC721.sol` Manually writed ERC-721 implementation from openzeppelin and interfacess. Created NFT contract and minted first 10 tokens. All functions work correctly. [19.10.2024]
